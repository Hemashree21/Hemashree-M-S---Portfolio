        I’m a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at PES University, RR Campus, with a passion for building impactful digital experiences. I enjoy learning new things, exploring diverse perspectives, and collaborating with people from different backgrounds.

        <br/> <br/>I love solving real-world problems through technology. Whether it's designing intuitive web interfaces or building full-fledged applications, I love bringing ideas to life.

        <br/> <br/>I love participating in Hackathons where I contribute to both coding and presentation aspects. From building sleek, responsive interfaces, to pitching the final product through visually engaging decks, I enjoy every part of the process. I often take the lead in crafting pitch presentations and delivering it, blending technical depth with compelling storytelling.
